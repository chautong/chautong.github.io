I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Communication](https://cals.cornell.edu/communication) at Cornell University. My pronouns are she/her/hers. 

I was born and grew up in Hanoi, Vietnam. I then came to Ewha Womans University in South Korea to complete my M.A. in Communication. In May 2021, I successfully defended my doctoral dissertation and earned a Ph.D. in Mass Communications from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a Ph.D. minor in Educational Psychology. 

My research specializations are in political communication, digital media, and public opinion. I apply computational social science methods, including NLP, network analysis, to study the interactions between technologies and societies, particular the areas of algorithmic bias & auditing, personalization, and the cultures of online mis/disinformation. 
 
At Cornell, one of my current research projects focuses on using computational methods to understand the potentials for misinformation and racial disparities in the public information environment about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening. 

Outreach and Extension Focus
======
As a working member of Credibility Coalition, a community-led collaboration focused on building solutions to online trust, verification, fact checking, and reader experience in the interest of addressing information disorder issues online, I am interested in applying science to community-based issues and producing social goods.
