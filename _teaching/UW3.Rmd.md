This **Online Communication and Interpersonal Relationships** course is an undergraduate course that introduces students to the emerging body of scholarship on how, and to what effects, people use these technologies to manage personal relationships. Each week, students examine a technological platform (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, online dating, online discussion forums) and discuss how relationship dynamics are shaped by this platform. For instance, how do people form impressions of others when communicating through purely textual media? In what ways do social network sites improve and hurt romantic relationships? 

My responsibilities include providing feedback and grading 2 exams and 3 assignments (2 pages each) for 60 students throughout the semester.
