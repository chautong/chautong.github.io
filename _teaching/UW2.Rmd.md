**Mass Media in Multicultural America** is an interesting and challenging course that is meant to stimulate thoughts on important topics surrounding contemporary issues in American society, including media depictions and portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities, race relations, cultures, diversity and inclusion, and the impact of such media portrayals on audiences' perceptions and attitudes. I worked with 150-200 students in two semesters in 2015 and 2016 and engaged them in open and deep discussions broadly related to the theme of the course.
