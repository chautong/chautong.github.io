I was invited to give two workshops to graduate students of **COMM 6750 - Research Methods for Social Networks and Social Media** at the **Cornell's Department of Communication**. The course aims to develop students' ability to use network methods and computational techniques to gather and analyze data to advance communication theories.

This workshop guides students to deploy the Twitter Academic API to collect publicly available tweets for research, data exploration and visualization. Students were also taught best practices in dealing with big data issues, including nested data format, unstructured text data, rate limit and memory. 

 * *Topic modelling and Word Embedding Analysis in R*, 
        * _November 17, 2021_
        * [codes](http://chautong.github.io/files/topicmodels.html)

This workshop uses news coverage on the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests as examples, to illustrate how text mining approaches, in particular topic modelling (LDA and STM) and word embeddings, can be used to understand public discourse. Students were introduced to R packages such as quanteda, topicmodels, stm and word2vec and walked through supervised and unsupervised methods to analyze text data.
