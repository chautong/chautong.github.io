This **Introduction to Mass Communication** course is an undergraduate course that introduces undergraduate students to key theories and concepts in journalism, strategic communication, public relations and advertising. It is a prerequisite class for students who want to enter the School of Journalism to pursue a career in the news and strategic communication industry. I worked with 36 - 40 students each Fall and Spring semester from 2014 through 2018, helped them develop and foster their writing and public speaking skills.
